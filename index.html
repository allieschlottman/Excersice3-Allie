    <p> Mac Miller was an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer known for his introspective lyrics and unique style that blended elements of hip-hop, jazz, and soul. Born Malcolm James McCormick in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Mac Miller began his music career as a teenager, releasing mixtapes that quickly gained a following. His debut album, Blue Slide Park (2011), was the first independently released album to top the Billboard 200 since 1995. Throughout his career, Mac Miller evolved musically, shifting from upbeat party anthems to more introspective and experimental sounds. Albums like Watching Movies with the Sound Off (2013), GO:OD AM (2015), and The Divine Feminine (2016) showcased his growth as an artist and his willingness to explore darker themes, including mental health and substance abuse. Miller was also known for his collaborations with other artists, including Ariana Grande, with whom he had a high-profile relationship. His final album, Swimming (2018), was critically acclaimed and highlighted his struggles with addiction and personal growth. Tragically, Mac Miller passed away in September 2018 due to an accidental drug overdose at 26 years old. His album, Circles (2020), was released to honor his legacy, cementing his impact on the music world as a talented, vulnerable, and influential artist. </p>
